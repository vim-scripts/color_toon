Shows the colors and the cterm/gui numbers of the colors. Shows the current syntax highlighting of the color scheme.
You can change the highlighting colors and save a copy
in a 'myjunk.vim' colorscheme.

Usage: Colortoon
       Colortoon d  - shows 2nd group of 127 cterm_gui colors
       Colortoon j  - sets colors from last myjunk.vim file
       
        (1) First, run Colortoon.
        (2) Get the desired range of colors into the NamedColors window:
              If cc is mapped to Colorchange as in the suggested setup,
              typing cc will type for you the command line:
              Colorchange h 9
              Following 9<Space>, type a number between 0 and 6.
                0 or blank - All the colors (too many for vim < 7)
                1 - 1st group of 182 named colors (only for guifg and guibg)
                2 - 2nd group of 182 named colors (only for guifg and guibg)
                3 - 3rd group of 182 named colors (only for guifg and guibg)
                4 - 1st group of 128 cterm_gui colors
                5 - 2nd group of 127 cterm_gui colors
                6 - All 255 cterm_gui colors (too many for vim < 7)

                4 or 5 is recommended.
                You may follow the number with a space and the letter r if you
                want to see color blocks instead of colored lettering.

              Step (2) may be repeated whenever desired.
                
        (3) Position to desired hi group in myjunk window and type :y b
        (4) Position to desired color in NamedColors window and type :y a
        (5) Colormake                 - Set foreground color per registers a,b
            Colormake b               - Set background color per registers a,b
            If you mapped cm to Colormake as in the suggested setup,
            type cm instead.

         In steps 3 & 4, ':y a' means :y<SPACEBAR>a<RETURN>
                                   or :yank<SPACEBAR>a<RETURN>
                                   or "ayy
 
                               ':y b' means :y<SPACEBAR>b<RETURN>
                                   or :yank<SPACEBAR>b<RETURN>
                                   or "byy
                         
                        If you consistently(!) reverse a and b, it still works.


You can also try editing the line in the myjunk window, then copy and 
paste that line to the command line which will also update highlighting.
You can copy the line with  yy
                 and paste it with  :@"
